                    Heya! I'm Pixilized

                But you can call me Pix. I'm many things:<br>
                <span class="blue">
                    A Programmer<br>
                    A Pixel Artist<br>
                    A Graphic Designer<br>
                    <del>A Furry</del><br>
                </span>
                And many more! But let's focus on one thing at a time.
                <br>Please note this site is unfinished! I'm working on it.<br><br>
                
                <div class="large">
                    Programming
                </div>
                <hr class="divider">
                Ah yes, this is where I really shine. I did this before I did anything else!
                I started out, like many programmers, in the wonderful world of
                <span class="blue">python</span>.
                A simple, beginner-friendly environment <span class="blue">rich</span> with possibility.
                I then moved to <span class="blue">Scratch</span>, and then <span class="blue">HTML</span>, and finally, <span class="blue">Godot</span>.
                (And also, briefly, my TI-84+ calculator).
                I haven't gone back to Python, but I've stuck with the others:<br>
                Game development, and web development. Let's talk more about those.<br><br>
                
                <div class="large">
                    Game Development
                </div>
                <hr class="divider">
                Ah yes. One of my favorites.<br>
                I enjoy this <span class="blue">quite</span> a lot! The majority of my games have been made on Scratch, but I also make games in Godot.
                (And on my calculator!).<br>
                You'll be able to see all my past, present, and future games in the <span class="blue">projects</span> tab.
                <br><br>

                <div class="large">
                    Web Development
                </div>
                <hr class="divider">
                Web development consists of using <span class="blue">HTML</span>, <span class="blue">CSS</span>, and occasionally <span class="blue">JavaScript</span> to make a website.
                <br>Which is exactly what I did to make <span class="blue">THIS</span> website!<br>
                I'm quite good at this, although I don't enjoy it nearly as much as game development.<br><br>

                <div class="large">
                    Pixel Art
                </div>
                <hr class="divider">
                My favorite thing to do to pass the time!<br>
                In fact, all of the art on this site is by me. Even the font!<br>
                Pixel art is <span class="blue">amazing</span>. Every pixel matters, and even one pixel can have a huge difference.<br>
                The retro look it has can change a game from good to great, and there are good pixel art editors everywhere!<br>
                I personally use Aseprite, but there are many others to choose from.<br><br>

                <div class="large">
                    Graphic Design
                </div>
                <hr class="divider">
                Ever seen logos? Or posters? That's <span class="blue">graphic design</span>!<br>
                It's the thing I do the least now, but I'm still decent at it!<br>
                Somehow.<br><br>

                <div class="large">
                    Hiring
                </div>
                <hr class="divider">
                If you want to hire me for any of these skills, click that nifty little <span class="blue">contact</span> tab up top,
                and it'll tell you where you can find and talk to me. That's all for now. Seeya!
